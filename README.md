##### Bana is a small Python-based text game where you play as a banana farmer who simply picks bananas and sells them on the market and pays the rent. But things can go beyond that. You can choose to take the bus or walk, when bussing, you risk traffic jams and when walking, you risk ambush and robbery. At the market, you can buy and sell a variety of items, set up accounts for healthcare, banking, and insurance.
